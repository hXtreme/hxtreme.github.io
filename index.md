title:  "About Me"

---

Hi, I am Harsh. My name's pronounced something along the lines of `Hursh`.
I'm starting my Masters in Computer Science(MSE-CIS) at University of Pennsylvania in Fall 2020.
During which I want to learn a lot more about Distributed systems, machine learning, programming languages.
I recently completed my under-graduate degree from Rutgers University --- Camden (also in computer science).

I have a resonably strong background in theoretical computer science and I want to use that to build things that make life easier for me as well as others.
Talking about making life easier, I also have an interest in UI/UX design;
I personally prefer a minimal and flat interface where subtle UI cues guide the user, something I plan to present via this very website.

I really like learning new things, esp. STEM related things but anything's fair game.
Due to this I know a few seemingly arbitrary set of facts,
one that I can always recall is that the length from your wrist to your elbow is the same length as you feet.
Yes you might look crazy for a second as you try to measure but, you'll be glad that you did.
