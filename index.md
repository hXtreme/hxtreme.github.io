Hello there, I'm Harsh (pronounced like "hush", but with a soft "r" sound)!
I recently completed my Master's degree in CIS at UPenn,
following my undergraduate degree in computer science at Rutgers University --- Camden.
During my academic career, I've focused on Programming Languages, Distributed Systems,
and Theoretical computer science, as well as dabbling in
Brain-Computer Interface, Machine Learning, UX and numerous other topics.

When I'm not coding, I enjoy playing rhythm games like OSU or DDR, even though I'm not particularly skilled at them.
I'm also a big fan of anime and manga, and enjoy exploring the sub-culture surrounding them.
In my free time, I like to keep learning new things, whether it's in the fields of science, economics, or language -- everything's fair game.

In addition to my love for learning, I have a strong desire to travel and experience different cultures around the world.
Exploring new places, and meeting new people is something that has always fascinated me.
It's my dream to visit and live in as many countries as possible.

Currently, I'm a part of the Infra team at Ikigai, where I'm fortunate to be surrounded by amazing colleagues whom I constantly learn new things from.
It's my first industry job and I'm enjoying every moment of it.
In the long-term, I aspire to start my own venture.

Thanks for taking the time to learn a little bit about me!
