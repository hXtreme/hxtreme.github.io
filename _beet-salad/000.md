A delightful beet salad that showcases the natural sweetness of roasted beets complemented by tangy goat cheese and candied walnuts. The arugula base provides a peppery contrast that elevates the entire dish.

## Highlights

- Perfectly roasted golden and red beets
- Generous portion of creamy goat cheese
- House-made candied walnuts add exceptional crunch
- Light citrus vinaigrette with subtle orange notes

## Notes

The presentation was beautiful with beets arranged in a colorful pattern. Could use a bit more citrus brightness to balance the earthy beets.
