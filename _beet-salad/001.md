## Highlights

- Overall it is a salad I would not order again.
- Squash and Beets didn't feel fresh maybe were canned of frozen.
- Creamy whipped ricotta cheese.
- Too sweet forward: beets, delicata squash, and honey all adding to it.
- Completely missing citrus notes, leaving the greens a bit pungent.
- Could do with more crunch.
