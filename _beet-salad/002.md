## Highlights

- Overall it's a easy to make and tasty homemade salad.
- Beets were pre-cooked and pumpkins seeds were a bit stale, tomatoes on the softer side.
- Combo of whipped goat cheese and chunks is hard to _beet_.
- Right amount of sweetness from beet but tomatoes were sweeter than tart.
- Lacked true citrus component but balsamic and tomatoes helped.
- Nice and varied crunch from fried onions and pumpkin seeds.

## Notes

- Might be better to use eiter grape tomatoes or angel sweet tomato for either bursting tart or sweet flavor.
- Fried onions can be subs for something baked to get a less oily end result.
